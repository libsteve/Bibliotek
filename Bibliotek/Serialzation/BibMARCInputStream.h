///          Otherwise, \c nil is returned and, if \c error is not \c NULL, its pointee is set to an \c NSError object
///          to indicate the reason for the failure. If there are no more records to be read from the input stream,
///          \c nil is returned without setting the \c error pointee to an \c NSError instance.
/// \pre If the input stream must be opened.
/// \post If the input stream is opened and \c nil is returned, \c streamStatus is set to \c NSStreamStatusError, and
///       \c streamError is set to an \c NSError object that indicates the reason for the failure.
/// \note If the input stream has not yet been opened, \c nil is returned with an error, but \c streamStatus and
///       \c streamError will not be set to reflect that failure. Attempting to read from the input stream after it is
///       opened will continue to read data as though it did not previously encounter an error.
/// \note If \c streamStatus is set to \c NSStreamStatusAtEnd when this method is called, \c nil is returned, but no
///       \c NSError is provided through the \c error pointer.
