/// An abstract class for a read-only stream of MARC records from encoded data.
///
/// ``BibRecordInputStream`` is the abstract superclass for a class cluster of concrete
/// stream classes that specialize reading different encodings for MARC 21 records. You
/// can instantiate one of those concrete classes directly if you know the encoding, or
/// you can use this class to have the class cluster automatically infer the encoding
/// for you.
///
/// Custom subclasses of ``BibRecordInputStream`` must provide implementations for
/// ``BibRecordInputStream/streamStatus``, ``BibRecordInputStream/streamError``,
/// ``BibRecordInputStream/open``, ``BibRecordInputStream/close``,
/// ``BibRecordInputStream/initWithInputStream:``, `-init`, and
/// ``BibRecordInputStream/readRecord:error:``.
