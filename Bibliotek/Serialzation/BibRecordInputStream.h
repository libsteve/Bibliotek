/// \c BibRecordInputStream is the abstract superclass for a class cluster of concrete
/// stream classes that specialize reading different encodings for MARC 21 records. You
/// can instantiate one of those concrete classes directly if you know the encoding, or
/// you can use this class to have the class cluster automatically infer the encoding
/// for you.

/// \note Custom subclasses of \c RecordInputStream must provide implementations for
///       \c -streamStatus \c streamError \c -open \c -close \c -initWithInputStream:
