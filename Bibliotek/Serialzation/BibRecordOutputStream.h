/// An abstract class for a write-only stream of MARC records as encoded data.

/// ``BibRecordOutputStream`` is the abstract superclass for a class cluster of concrete
/// stream classes that specialize writing different encodings for MARC 21 records. You
/// can instantiate one of those concrete classes directly if you know the encoding, or
/// you can use this class to have the class cluster automatically infer the encoding
/// for you.
///
/// Custom subclasses of ``BibRecordOutputStream`` must provide implementations for
/// ``BibRecordOutputStream/streamStatus``, ``BibRecordOutputStream/streamError``,
/// ``BibRecordOutputStream/open``, ``BibRecordOutputStream/close``,
/// ``BibRecordOutputStream/hasSpaceAvailable``, ``BibRecordOutputStream/data``,
/// ``BibRecordOutputStream/initWithOutputStream:``, `-init`, and
/// ``BibRecordOutputStream/writeRecord:error:``.
