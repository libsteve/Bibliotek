/// The semantic meaning of a record field is indicated by its ``BibRecordField/fieldTag`` value.
///
/// Control fields contain information and metadata about how a record's content should be processed.
///
/// Data fields are composed of ``BibRecordField/subfields``, which are portions of data semantically identified by
/// their ``BibSubfield/subfieldCode``. The interpretation of data within a content field is often determined by its
/// indicators and the formatting of its subfields' contents. For example, a bibliographic record's title statement,
/// identified with the tag `245`, formats its content using ISBD principles and uses subfield codes to semantically
/// tag each piece of the full statement.
